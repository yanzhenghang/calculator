-->

**Problem Statement**
<!-- What problem are we trying to solve? Who’s the target audience? Is there a customer need or
pain point we need to remedy? Is there a business goal or metric we are trying to improve? Do we
have a hypothesis we want to prove or disprove? -->

**Evidence or User Insights**
<!-- Why should we do this? Potential sources of data: Feedback Hub, other GitHub issues, other
anecdotes from listening to customers in person or online, request from another team, telemetry
data, user research, market or competitive research -->

**Proposal**
<!-- How will the solution/feature help us solve the problem? How will it meet the target
audience’s needs? If there are business goals or metrics, how does this improve them? -->

**Goals**
<!-- What you want to accomplish with this feature. Typical examples include
“User Can *perform some task*” -->

**Non-Goals**
<!-- Things we are explicitly not doing or supporting or that are out of scope, including reasons
why. -->

**Low-Fidelity Concept**
<!-- Show as much of the experience as needed to explain the idea. This can be as simple as a
napkin drawing but can also be a code prototype, a PowerPoint walkthrough, or a design
comp. -->
